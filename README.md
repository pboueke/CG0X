##What is it?

See for yourself: [PONGO](http://pboueke.github.io/CG0X/#)

(you must be using a modern browser)

It's a simple 3D pong game, still missing some pieces. It's made with the [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) framework and some other bits.

##Why?

This was a project for the Computer Graphics course at UFRJ. And was really fun to make.

##Features
